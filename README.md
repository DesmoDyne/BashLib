# BashLib

A [DesmoDyne](https://www.desmodyne.com) project that provides a library of generic Bash shell functions.

At this stage, this library does not provide a lot of generically useful functionality; it was mostly created to reduce code duplication in projects that use it - which are required to some extent to stick to a certain set of conventions.
